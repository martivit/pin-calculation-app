    "Title": "# Calculating Education Cluster People in Need (PiN)",
    "methodology": "Calculating the People in Need (PiN) for the Education sector within a Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) involves aggregating data on educational needs from various geographic regions and groups affected by crises.\n\nThis process, guided by UN's OCHA, helps in planning and resource allocation by detailing the size and severity of educational needs across different areas and populations, including displaced persons and locals. The PiN calculation provides crucial insights into where and how resources should be distributed, with data broken down by geographic location, affected group, severity of educational conditions, and gender.\n\n### How to use this PiN calculator tool?\n\n**üëà Following the order shown in the sidebar**\n\n- Select your country, **upload the MSNA data** and the OCHA population data (if present);\n- Check and pick the education indicators and sort out the education barriers according to the severity category;\n- Calculate the PiN!\n- Download the final tables. If OCHA population figures were provided, the results will show the final number of People in Need.\n- The results are disaggregated per: \n  - Gender\n  - Geographical area\n  - Different affected groups as defined in the humanitarian profile of the country (IDPs, residents, returnees, refugees)\n  - Severity of education conditions, determined by the degree of unmet needs across the four dimensions\n  - PiN dimensions\n\nThe platform has been developed by GEC, with the support of its global partner IMPACT.\n\n#### Questions? Issues?\nYou can contact: Marie-Amandine GRAND <marie-amandine.grand@impact-initiatives.org> and Martina VIT <martina.vit@impact-initiatives.org>",
